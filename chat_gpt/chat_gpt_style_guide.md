  desktop monitors).
- Utilize a fluid layout that can adjust and adapt to different terminal window sizes without sacrificing readability or
  usability.
- Avoid fixed-width elements that may cause horizontal scrolling or clipping in smaller terminal windows.
- Optimize the font sizes, line heights, and other typographic elements to ensure readability across different screen
  resolutions.
- Test the CLI interface on different screen resolutions to verify that the text remains legible and well-proportioned.
- Consider the dynamic sizing of interface elements, such as buttons or input fields, to accommodate varying terminal
  window sizes.
- Ensure that buttons and interactive elements are large enough to be easily clickable or selectable, even on smaller
  screens.
- Strive for consistency in the visual design and layout across different terminal environments, maintaining a cohesive
  user experience.
