Task: Define the feature prioritization framework

Outcome: Establish a framework for prioritizing features based on user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility.

To define the feature prioritization framework, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify User Needs:
    - Conduct thorough user research and gather insights on the needs, pain points, and preferences of the target
      audience.
    - Analyze user feedback, interviews, and surveys to identify common themes and prioritize features that address the
      most critical user needs.

2. Align with Business Goals:
    - Collaborate with stakeholders, including the Product Manager, Project Manager, and other relevant team members, to
      define the overarching business goals.
    - Identify features that directly contribute to achieving those goals, such as improving user satisfaction,
      increasing revenue, or gaining a competitive advantage.

3. Assess Technical Feasibility:
    - Engage with the development team, including software engineers, AI specialists, and UX/UI designers, to evaluate
      the technical feasibility of implementing each feature.
    - Consider factors such as existing infrastructure, resource availability, complexity, and potential impact on other
      features.

4. Apply Prioritization Techniques:
    - Utilize prioritization techniques such as MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have), the Kano model,
      or the Eisenhower Matrix.
    - Assign priority levels to each feature based on its importance to users, alignment with business goals, and
      technical feasibility.

5. Consider Dependencies and Relationships:
    - Identify dependencies among features and consider the impact of prioritizing one feature over another.
    - Evaluate the relationships between features and assess if any features need to be developed together to ensure
      functionality and coherence.

6. Regularly Review and Iterate:
    - Establish a process for regular review and iteration of the feature prioritization framework.
    - Gather feedback from stakeholders, development team members, and users to refine and adjust feature priorities as
      needed.

By following these steps, we will establish a comprehensive feature prioritization framework that considers user needs,
business goals, and technical feasibility. This framework will serve as a guide for making informed decisions about
feature development and resource allocation.

Task: Identify User Needs

1. Review User Research Insights:
    - Analyze the user research findings, including the interview with Ben, to gain a deep understanding of user needs,
      pain points, and preferences.
    - Identify recurring themes and common challenges mentioned by the target audience.

2. Categorize User Needs:
    - Organize the user needs into categories or themes based on their nature and impact on the product development.
    - For example, categorize needs related to communication, product planning, code generation, and autonomous
      execution.

3. Prioritize User Needs:
    - Assess the importance and impact of each user need based on factors such as frequency of mention, alignment with
      the
      product vision, and potential value to the target audience.
    - Prioritize the user needs by creating a ranked list or matrix to guide feature prioritization and decision-making.

4. Validate User Needs:
    - Validate the identified user needs through additional user feedback sessions or interviews, if necessary.
    - Refine the prioritization based on any new insights or feedback received.

Outcome:
The outcome of this task is a clear understanding of the user needs, their prioritization, and their alignment with the
product vision. This information will guide the feature development and ensure that OpenAI MAC addresses the critical
pain points and requirements of the target audience.

Please note that the user research insights documented earlier will serve as a valuable resource for conducting this
task.
