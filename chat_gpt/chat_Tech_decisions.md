Technical Decisions Documentation - OpenAI MAC CLI Application

1. CLI Framework: Click

   - Decision: We decided to use the Click framework for implementing the command-line interface (CLI) of the OpenAI MAC
     application.
   - Rationale: Click is a popular and widely used Python package for creating command-line interfaces. It provides a
     simple and intuitive syntax for defining commands, options, and arguments. Click offers built-in support for handling
     user input, parsing command-line arguments, and generating help messages. It also integrates well with testing
     frameworks, making it easier to write test cases for the CLI application.
   - Benefits: By using Click, we can leverage its powerful features to build a user-friendly CLI with minimal effort. The
     framework provides consistency and standardization in command-line interactions, ensuring a familiar experience for
     users. Click's extensive documentation and active community support also make it an excellent choice for long-term
     maintainability and scalability.

2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

   - Decision: We adopted a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for implementing the CLI application's functions and
     features.
   - Rationale: TDD promotes a structured and systematic development process by writing tests before writing the actual
     implementation code. This approach helps ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and meets the specified
     requirements. TDD encourages modular and decoupled code, making it easier to maintain, refactor, and extend the
     application in the future. By writing tests upfront, we can also detect and address issues early in the development
     process, leading to higher code quality and reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs.
   - Benefits: TDD provides clear and specific guidelines for implementing features, reducing ambiguity and improving
     development efficiency. It allows for more confident code changes, as any modifications should be covered by existing
     tests. TDD also facilitates collaboration between team members, as the tests serve as a shared understanding of the
     desired behavior and expected outcomes.

3. Testing Framework: pytest

   - Decision: We chose pytest as the testing framework for the CLI application.
   - Rationale: pytest is a mature and widely adopted testing framework in the Python ecosystem. It offers a rich set of
     features, including a concise syntax for writing tests, powerful assertion capabilities, support for fixtures, and
     extensive plugin ecosystem. pytest integrates well with Click, making it straightforward to test CLI commands and
     options. It also provides built-in code coverage reporting, allowing us to measure and track the test coverage of our
     codebase.
   - Benefits: Using pytest enables us to write clear and expressive tests, making it easier to understand the test cases
     and their expected outcomes. The framework's extensive ecosystem of plugins provides additional capabilities, such as
     test parameterization, test discovery, and test parallelization. pytest's code coverage reporting helps ensure that
     our tests adequately cover the codebase, giving us confidence in the application's quality and stability.

4. Code Linter: ruff

   - Decision: We selected ruff as the code linter for maintaining code style and enforcing best practices.
   - Rationale: ruff is a lightweight and configurable code linter that follows the PEP 8 style guidelines and offers
     additional rules to enhance code quality. It helps enforce consistent code formatting, naming conventions, and code
     structure across the project. ruff provides options for automatically fixing linting issues (--fix) and reporting
     linting errors, making it easier to maintain code quality and readability.
   - Benefits: By using ruff, we can ensure a consistent coding style throughout the project, enhancing code
     maintainability and readability. The linter helps catch potential issues early, reducing the likelihood of introducing
     bugs and improving overall code quality. The ability to automatically fix linting issues simplifies the process of
     adhering to coding standards and frees developers from manually making formatting corrections.

5. Project Configuration: setup.py and pyproject.toml

   - Decision: We chose to use setup.py and pyproject.toml as the project configuration files.

   - Rationale: setup.py is a standard file used for configuring and packaging Python projects. It allows us to define
     project metadata, dependencies, entry points, and other package-related details. pyproject.toml is a newer
     configuration file used for project-level tooling configuration. It is supported by various Python build systems and
     tools, including pytest and ruff. pyproject.toml provides a centralized location to configure project-specific
     settings, including testing and linting configurations.
   - Benefits: Using setup.py enables us to define the project's metadata and dependencies in a standardized way, making it
     easier for users to install and use the CLI application. pyproject.toml allows us to configure testing with pytest and
     linting with ruff, ensuring consistent behavior across different development environments. Having clear and
     well-structured project configurations enhances project maintainability and facilitates collaboration among team
     members.
