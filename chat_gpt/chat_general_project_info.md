## Strategic approach

The strategic approach for OpenAI MAC involves creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) application in Python. This CLI
app will leverage OpenAI technology and utilize different prompts to create AI agents that act as a development team.
The AI agents will engage in a dialogue with the user, capturing the product vision, asking clarifying questions, and
generating the necessary code or components for product development.

This strategy enables a seamless and interactive user experience, where users can conveniently interact with the AI
Development team through the command line interface. By leveraging OpenAI technology, the CLI app can harness the power
of natural language processing and machine learning to facilitate effective communication and collaboration between
users and the AI agents.

## Scope

## User Research

User Research Insights - Ben Interview

During the interview with Ben, our first user, we gathered valuable insights regarding his experience and expectations
related to developing complex digital products. Here are the key findings:

1. Experience with Developing Complex Digital Products:
    - Ben mentioned that developing complex digital products involves extensive planning and long development periods.
    - He expressed the challenge of defining different features and parts during the development process.

2. Communicating Product Vision and Requirements:
    - Ben highlighted that he currently does not have a specific method or tool to communicate his product vision and
      requirements.
    - Limited resources prevent him from engaging with a development team or experts.

3. Key Aspects and Functionalities:
    - Ben emphasized the importance of having a detailed execution plan and a guide to facilitate fast implementation of
      functions.
    - Code generation based on the execution plan was identified as the next crucial step in his development process.

4. Ideal User Experience:
    - Ben expressed his preference for the tool to question him about the product he wants to create.
    - He expects the tool to generate an execution plan, starting from a global roadmap down to epics, user stories, and
      simple tasks that an inexperienced person can handle.
    - Ben also mentioned that the tool should conduct interviews for further guidance on the product's usage and target
      audience.
    - The tool should eventually execute the execution plan autonomously, generating the digital product (e.g., apps,
      servers, websites, etc.).

These user research insights will serve as a foundation for designing OpenAI MAC. They provide valuable guidance on the
desired features, functionalities, and user experience that align with Ben's needs. We will leverage these insights to
shape the product roadmap, prioritize development efforts, and ensure that OpenAI MAC effectively addresses the
challenges faced by our target audience.
