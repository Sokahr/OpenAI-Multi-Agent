## Goals

1. Goal 1: Enable Cost-Effective Product Development - The goal is to provide a solution that significantly reduces the
   cost of developing complex digital products by automating the development process and minimizing the need for
   external experts.
2. Goal 2: Enhance Time Efficiency - The goal is to streamline the product development process, saving valuable time for
   users by automating tasks and facilitating efficient communication with the AI Development team.

## Strategic approach

The strategic approach for OpenAI MAC involves creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) application in Python. This CLI
app will leverage OpenAI technology and utilize different prompts to create AI agents that act as a development team.
The AI agents will engage in a dialogue with the user, capturing the product vision, asking clarifying questions, and
generating the necessary code or components for product development.

This strategy enables a seamless and interactive user experience, where users can conveniently interact with the AI
Development team through the command line interface. By leveraging OpenAI technology, the CLI app can harness the power
of natural language processing and machine learning to facilitate effective communication and collaboration between
users and the AI agents.
